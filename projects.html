													<p style="text-align: justify;  text-justify: inter-word;"> In this project, parallel image processing techniques were implemented using OpenMP and CUDA, resulting in a significant improvement in processing time for complex image filtering, feature extraction, and segmentation tasks. By leveraging the power of multiple cores and GPUs, the parallel approach was able to break down the processing workload into smaller, independent tasks that could be executed simultaneously, resulting in a 3x reduction in image processing time compared to a sequential approach. This improvement in performance was particularly noticeable for large and complex image datasets, where the computational demands of traditional processing methods can become a bottleneck. The use of OpenMP and CUDA allowed for more efficient utilization of available hardware resources, resulting in faster and more accurate image analysis and processing. Overall, the parallel image processing project demonstrated the potential for leveraging modern computing architectures to accelerate image analysis and processing tasks, with significant benefits for research, industry, and medical applications</p>
